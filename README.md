# Calendar

## Introduction

I developed a personal calendar app (event management app) when I was in my college freshman year. The coding structure was a blatant catastrophe, and therefore I decided to re-write the program in a more organized way. However, I still miss the days back then, when there was no covid, or war, and when I did not have so much to take on and move on, and when I still got someone to miss.



Without further ado, we have to move on. This app is for event-management, and it helps you to keep track of your tasks.
